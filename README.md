<!--
**PixelPerfectMind/PixelPerfectMind** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on nothing special, so far
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning nothing special, so far
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on .NET WPF applications
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with some Frontend stuff
- ðŸ’¬ Don't invite me to meetings to discuss what will be discussed in the next meeting - one email is enough!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He / Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: you can center a `<div />` element with some inline CSS: `style="display: flex; margin: auto;"`
